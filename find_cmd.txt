The find command is used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on conditions like name, type, size, modification time, and permissions.

Basic Syntax:
find [path] [options] [expression]


#Find a file based on name
find /path/to/directory -type f -name "NAME_OF_THE_FILE"


#Find a directory based on name
find /path/to/directory -type d -name "NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER"


#Find the file/directory which has the size more than 100MB
find /path/to/directory -size +100M


#Find the file/directory which has the size less than 100MB
find /path/to/directory -size -100M



#Find the file/directory which has the size between 100-200MB
find /path/to/directory -size +100M -size -200M


#Any command needs to run on each file from find output. Lets say you want to remove files less than 50MB. find /path/to/search -name "pattern" -exec command {} \;
find /path/to/directory -size -100M -exec rm {}


#Search for Files by Modified Time. Find all files modified in the last 7 days in /etc
find /etc -mtime -7


#Based on access time. Find files not accessed in the last 30 days in /home
find /home -atime +30


#Based on permissions assigned on files. Find all files with 777 permissions in /var/www.
find /var/www -perm 777


#Find all files created in the last 2 days.
find / -ctime -2


#Based on user. Find all files owned by the user john
