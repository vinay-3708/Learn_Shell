#Creating a Volume and attach to VM:

To list the attached volumes in the VM:
"lsblk"


To list the file-systems present in VM:
"fdisk -l"   or  "df -h"


Create a file-system using the below command:
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX        #/dev/sdX is the Volume name in lsblk


Mount the volume to a directory:
sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/newVolume 


Make the attachment always attached to VM when re-booted: Add the below line to /etc/fstab
echo '/dev/sdX /mnt/myvolume ext4 defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab




#Unmounting the volume:

To unmount volume:
sudo umount /dev/sdX /mnt/newVolume


And Delete the line in /etc/fstab
