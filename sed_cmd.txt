#The sed (Stream Editor) command is used for text manipulation and editing in files or streams without opening them in a text editor. It is widely used in automation, scripting, and log processing.
#Basic Syntax is:
#   sed [options] 'script' [file...]


#Replace the nth occurance of keyword with new keyword in each line
sed 's/old_kw/new_kw/3' example.txt   #This will replaces the 3rd old_kw with new_kw in each line of file.

#Replace all occurrences in a line
sed 's/old/new/g' file

#Replace a String Only on Specific Lines ,i.e from 2 to 4.
sed '2,4s/old/new/' file

#use -i option to store the changes directly into the file
sed 's/old/new/g' file

#Delete a specific line number. The below will delete the 5th line and prints the remaining.
sed '5d' file  

#Delete range of lines from 2 to 5 in a file
sed '2,5d' file

#Delete lines matching a pattern
sed '/pattern/d' file

#Print any specific line. The below will print line 5.
sed -n '5p' file

#Print range of lines
sed -n '2,5p' file

#Print matched lines
sed -n '/pattern/p' file


#NOTE: Instead of '/', we can use any delimiter like '|' or anyother
